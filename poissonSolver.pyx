'''
Solves a poisson problem with the finite integration approach.

This method was written to be fast for solving the poisson problem
several times with different right hand side (i.e. the charge vector).
Change LU decomposition to iterative solver (e.g. spspl.bicgstab)
if used otherwise.

Requires scipy.sparse (spsp) and scipy.sparse.linalg (spspl).
